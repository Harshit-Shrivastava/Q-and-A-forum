    Do I have to log in or create an account?<br />
    You can answer and suggest edits as an anonymous user, much like Wikipedia. There are some things you won’t be able to do on the site without registering, such as vote or ask new questions. But it’s easy to register.
    <br /><hr /><br />

    What if I don’t get a good answer?<br />
First, make sure you’ve asked a good question. To get better answers, you may need to put additional effort into your question. Edit your question to provide status and progress updates. Document your own continued efforts to answer your question. This will naturally bump your question and get more people interested in it.
<br /><hr /><br />

What if I see bad things happening?<br />
Each post and comment has a small flag link. Click the flag link to let us know about problems and we'll follow up.
<br /><hr /><br />

 Can I use a signature or tagline?<br />
Please don’t use signatures or taglines in your posts, or they will be removed.
<br /><hr /><br />

 May I promote products or websites I am affiliated with here?<br />
Be careful, because the community frowns on overt self-promotion and tends to vote it down and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, so be it. However, you must disclose your affiliation in your answers.
